## Baby Time

### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to combine intuitions regarding the month of conception for Rebecca and Ryan's first born child.
After the wedding it was well known that Rebecca was suffering from sever baby fever. The unknown variable however was how Ryan was going to go about calming this restlessness. 

### Theory

Incentives drive research. To compile the maximum amount of information as possible about the working minds of Rebecca and Ryan we needed to combine all the small details of their day to day lives. This was acomplished through a bet/reward incentive program. Persons close to the couple we're given the opertunity to become god-parents of the child if they correctly guess the month of conception. 

### Practice

In practice the friends and family near the couple poked and proded for information. They created theories and submitted the educated guesses. 

### Results

Ryan and Rebecca are still childless.
